# PyTorch implementation of FCN-based models for semantic segmentation
This repository contains some FCN-based models and the pipeline of training and evaluating models.

##Models
Vanilla FCN: FCN32, FCN16, FCN8, in the versions of VGG19, ResNet152 and DenseNet respectively.

##TODO:
SegNet
PSPNet
DeepLab
CRFAsRNN
And so on
